/**
 *  A base class for objects that can be persisted via afw::table::io Archive classes.
 *
 *  Inheriting from Persistable provides a public API for reading/writing individual objects to
 *  FITS that is fully defined in the base class, with derived classes only needing to implement
 *  persistence to catalogs.  It is expected that objects that contain multiple persistables
 *  (such as Exposures) will create their own InputArchives and OutputArchives, and use these
 *  to avoid writing the same object twice (which would otherwise be a big concern for future
 *  objects like ExposureCatalog and CoaddPsf).
 *
 *  Generally speaking, an abstract base class that inherits from Persistable should
 *  also inherit from PersistableFacade<Base>.
 *  A concrete class that inherits (possibly indirectly) from Persistable should inherit from
 *  PersistableFacade<Derived> (though this just provides a slightly nicer interface to users),
 *  implement isPersistable(), getPersistenceName(), getPythonModule(), and write(),
 *  and define a subclass of PersistenceFactory.  Inheritance from PersistableFacade should
 *  always precede inheritance from Persistable.
 *
 *  Persistable has no pure virtual member functions, and instead contains a default implementation
 *  that throws LogicError when the user attempts to save an object for which persistence
 *  has not actually been implemented.
