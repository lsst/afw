/**
 *  A spatially-varying transmission curve as a function of wavelength.
 *
 *  TransmissionCurve can only be evaluated at discrete (albeit arbitrary)
 *  user-provided positions; it does not provide an interface for computing
 *  average transmission over regions or computing spatially-varying scalars
 *  from integrals over the wavelength dimension.
 *
 *  TransmissionCurves are immutable and are expected to be passed and held by
 *  shared_ptr<TransmissionCurve const>.  As such they are neither copyable
 *  nor movable (because there should be no need to copy or move).
 *
 *  All wavelength values should be in Angstroms.
 *
 *  The flux units and overall normalization of TransmissionCurves is
 *  unspecified by the class, but their normalization and units should always
 *  be consistent throughout the spatial area over which they are defined
 *  (an implementation should not e.g. re-normalize to unit bolometric flux
 *  at each position it is evaluated at).  Other classes and functions using
 *  TransmissionCurves should of course document the flux units and/or
 *  normalization expected/provided.
