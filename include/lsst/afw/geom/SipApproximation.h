/**
 *  A fitter and results class for approximating a general Transform in a form compatible with
 *  FITS WCS persistence.
 *
 *  The Simple Imaging Polynomial (SIP) convention (Shupe et al 2005) adds
 *  forward and reverse polynomial mappings to a standard projection FITS WCS
 *  projection (e.g. "TAN" for gnomonic) that relate Intermediate World
 *  Coordinates (see Calabretta & Greisen 2002) to image pixel coordinates.
 *  The SIP "forward" transform is defined by polynomial coeffients @f$A@f$
 *  and @f$B@f$ that map pixel coordinates @f$(u, v)@f$ to Intermediate World
 *  Coordinates @f$(x, y)@f$ via
 *  @f[
 *     \boldsymbol{S}\left[\begin{array}{c}
 *        x \\
 *        y
 *     \end{array}\right]
 *     \equiv
 *     \left[\begin{array}{c}
 *        x_s \\
 *        y_s
 *     \end{array}\right]
 *     =
 *     \left[\begin{array}{c}
 *        (u - u_0) + \displaystyle\sum_{p,q}^{0 \le p + q \le N} \mathrm{A}_{p,q} (u - u_0)^p (v - v_0)^q \\
 *        (v - v_0) + \displaystyle\sum_{p,q}^{0 \le p + q \le N} \mathrm{B}_{p,q} (u - u_0)^p (v - v_0)^q
 *     \end{array}\right]
 *  @f]
 *  The reverse transform has essentially the same form:
 *  @f[
 *     \left[\begin{array}{c}
 *        u - u_0 \\
 *        v - v_0
 *     \end{array}\right]
 *     =
 *     \left[\begin{array}{c}
 *        x_s + \displaystyle\sum_{p,q}^{0 \le p + q \le N} \mathrm{AP}_{p,q} x_s^p y_s^q \\
 *        y_s + \displaystyle\sum_{p,q}^{0 \le p + q \le N} \mathrm{BP}_{p,q} x_s^p y_s^q
 *     \end{array}\right]
 *  @f]
 *  In both cases, @f$(u_0, v_0)@f$ is the pixel origin (CRPIX in FITS WCS) and
 *  @f$\boldsymbol{S}@f$ is the *inverse* of the Jacobian "CD" matrix.  Both
 *  CRPIX and CD are considered fixed inputs, and we do not attempt to null
 *  the zeroth- and first-order terms of @f$A@f$ and @f$B@f$ (as some SIP
 *  fitters do); together, these conventions make solving for the coefficients
 *  a much simpler linear problem.
 *
 *  @note In the implementation, we typically refer to @f$(u-u_0, v-v_0)@f$ as
 *  @c dpix (for "pixel delta"), and @f$(x_s, y_s)@f$ as @c siwc (for "scaled
 *  intermediate world coordinates").
 *
 *  While LSST WCSs are in general too complex to be described exactly in FITS
 *  WCS, they can generally be closely approximated by standard FITS WCS
 *  projection with additional SIP distortions.  This class fits such an
 *  approximation, given a TransformPoint2ToPoint2 object that represents the
 *  exact mapping from pixels to Intermediate World Coordinates with a SIP
 *  distortion.
