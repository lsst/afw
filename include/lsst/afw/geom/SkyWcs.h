/**
 * A 2-dimensional celestial WCS that transform pixels to ICRS RA/Dec, using the LSST standard for pixels.
 *
 * SkyWcs is an immutable object that can not only represent any standard FITS WCS, but can also contain
 * arbitrary Transforms, e.g. to model optical distortion or pixel imperfections.
 *
 * In order to make a SkyWcs that models optical distortion, say, it is usually simplest to start with
 * a standard FITS WCS (such as a TAN WCS) as an approximation, then insert a transform that models
 * optical distortion by calling makeModifiedWcs. However, it is also possible to build a SkyWcs
 * entirely from transforms, if you prefer, by building an ast::FrameDict and constructing the SkyWcs from
 * that.
 *
 * @anchor skywcs_frames **Frames of reference**
 *
 * SkyWcs internally keeps track of the following frames of reference:
 * - ACTUAL_PIXELS (optional): "actual" pixel position using the @ref pixel_position_standards "LSST
 * standard". This has the same meaning as the lsst.afw.cameraGeom.ACTUAL_PIXELS frame: actual pixels include
 * effects such as "tree ring" distortions and electrical effects at the edge of CCDs. This frame should
 * only be provided if there is a reasonable model for these imperfections.
 * - PIXELS: nominal pixel position, using the @ref pixel_position_standards "LSST standard".
 *     This has the same meaning as the lsst.afw.cameraGeom.PIXELS frame:
 *     nominal pixels may be rectangular, but are uniform in size and spacing.
 * - IWC: intermediate world coordinates (the FITS WCS concept).
 * - SKY: position on the sky as ICRS, with standard RA, Dec axis order.
 *
 * @anchor pixel_position_standards **Pixel position standards**
 *
 * The LSST standard for pixel position is: 0,0 is the center of the lower left image pixel.
 * The FITS standard for pixel position is: 1,1 is the center of the lower left image pixel.
 *
 * LSST and FITS also use a different origin for subimages:
 * - LSST pixel position is in the frame of reference of the parent image
 * - FITS pixel position is in the frame of reference of the subimage
 * However, SkyWcs does *not* keep track of this difference. Code that persists and unpersists SkyWcs
 * using FITS-WCS header cards must handle the offset, e.g. by calling `copyAtShiftedPixelOrigin`
 *
 * @anchor skywcs_frameDict **Internal details: the contained ast::FrameDict**
 *
 * SkyWcs contains an ast::FrameDict which transforms from pixels to sky (in radians) in the forward
 * direction.
 *
 * This FrameDict contains the named frames described in @ref skywcs_frames "frames of reference", e.g.
 * "SKY", "IWC", "PIXELS" and possibly "ACTUAL_PIXELS". "SKY" is the current frame.
 *  If "ACTUAL_PIXELS" is present then it is the base frame, otherwise "PIXELS" is the base frame. 
 *
 * The "SKY" frame is of type ast::SkyFrame and has the following attributes:
 * - `SkyRef` is set to the sky origin of the WCS (ICRS RA, Dec) in radians.
 * - `SkyRefIs` is set to "Ignored" so that SkyRef is not used in transformations.
 *
 * The other frames are of type ast::Frame and have 2 axes.
