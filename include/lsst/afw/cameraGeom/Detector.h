/**
 * A helper class for Detector that allows amplifiers and most fields to be
 * modified.
 *
 * Because Detector is immutable, creation and modification always go through
 * Builder, or more precisely, one of its two subclasses:
 *  - InCameraBuilder (obtained from Camera::Builder) is used to construct
 *    new detectors or modify them as part of Camera.
 *  - PartialRebuilder (obtained from Detector::rebuild) is used to modify
 *    an existing detector without changing its relationship to its camera.
 *
 * Detector::Builder itself provides functionality common to these:
 *  - setters for the simple data fields of Detector;
 *  - a container of Amplifier::Builders.
 * It is not intended define an interface independent of its subclasses.
 *
 * The name and ID of a detector (but not its "serial" string) are set at
 * initial construction and are an integral part of the relationship between
 * it and its Camera, and can never be changed, even by Builders.
 *
 * The fact that Amplifier::Builder inherits from Amplifier does not mean that
 * a container of Amplifier::Builder can inherit from a container of Amplifier,
 * and hence Detector::Builder (which has a container of Amplifer::Builder)
 * cannot inherit directly from Detector (which has a container of Amplifier).
 * But in both Python and templated C++ code, the container interfaces of
 * Detector and Detector::Builder are identical (i.e. they're "duck type"
 * equivalent), aside from the fact that Detector::Builder also permits
 * addition and removal of amplifiers.
