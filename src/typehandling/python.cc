For compatibility with C++, ``)docstring" +
                            className + R"docstring(`` has the following restrictions:
    - all keys must be )docstring" + keyName +
                            R"docstring(
    - values must be built-in types or subclasses of `lsst.afw.typehandling.Storable`.
      Almost any user-defined class in C++ or Python can have
      `~lsst.afw.typehandling.Storable` as a mixin.

As a safety precaution, `~lsst.afw.typehandling.Storable` objects that are
added from C++ may be copied when you retrieve them from Python, making it
impossible to modify them in-place. This issue does not affect objects that
are added from Python, or objects that are always passed by
:cpp:class:`shared_ptr` in C++.
